Code to illustrate S.O.L.I.D. principles

[DevIQ - SOLID](https://deviq.com/principles/solid)

- SRP - Single Responsibility Principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
- OCP - Open/Closed Principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  - [Nice example](https://www.oodesign.com/open-close-principle.html)
- LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
- ISP - Interface Segregation Principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
- DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle:  "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."
